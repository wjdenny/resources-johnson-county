# Resources for New Iowans in Johnson County

In 2016, I took on the project of collecting and verifying information about
social services that might be of interest to recent immigrants to our area,
Johnson County, Iowa. That project has since been used by Kirkwood Community College's
library and learning center. It was originally available as [a shared document on
Google
Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EjUjH2K3kxGGxW24Bo98vRCNDxFYLBHk60y_asuiR3I/edit#heading=h.eg9f677utci3), but I wanted to make it available to a wider public, help), but I wanted to make it available to a wider public, help
organize efforts to contribute updates to the information, and provide a tool
that can be used in other locations as well.
